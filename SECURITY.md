# Security Policy
We take the security of the Spotlight JS project seriously and appreciate the community's efforts in reporting vulnerabilities responsibly.
## Supported Versions

We currently accept and prioritize vulnerability reports only for the **latest stable version** of the library. Users are strongly encouraged to always upgrade to the most recent release.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.2   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0.2   | :x:              |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
We ask that all newly discovered vulnerabilities be reported **confidentially and responsibly** before public disclosure.

### How to Report

**Do not use the public GitHub Issues tracker.**

Vulnerability reports must be submitted through the **GitHub Security Advisory** feature in your repository. This process ensures that the vulnerability details are known **only to the project maintainers** until a patch is ready for release.

To submit a report:

1. Navigate to the **Security** tab of your repository.

2. Select **Report a vulnerability**.
